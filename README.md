# MATLAB to Python: Enrichment and Network Analysis Case Study

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the translation of a legacy MATLAB analytical workflow
into a fully functional Python-based pipeline. The goal was to replicate and
modernise an existing analysis while improving readability, documentation, and
reproducibility.

The project includes differential analysis, enrichment analysis, and network
visualisation, with an emphasis on generating interpretable insights from complex
datasets. While the data originates from a biological use case, the analytical
approach and technical skills are broadly applicable to data science, analytics,
and insight-driven decision-making in industry settings.

## Objectives
- Convert a MATLAB live script into a Python Jupyter Notebook
- Rebuild supporting MATLAB functions in Python
- Ensure functional parity between the original and converted pipelines
- Generate clear visualisations to support interpretation
- Document the workflow for users unfamiliar with the original codebase

## Methods
- Data manipulation and analysis using Pandas
- Visualisation using Matplotlib
- Network construction and analysis using NetworkX
- Modular function design to replace MATLAB dependencies
- Extensive inline documentation for clarity and maintainability

## Key Outcomes
- Successfully replicated all analytical outputs from the original MATLAB pipeline
- Improved code readability and modularity in the Python implementation
- Generated interpretable visual outputs including enrichment plots and network
  diagrams
- Demonstrated the ability to modernise legacy analytical systems

## Tools Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NetworkX

## Takeaways
This project highlights the importance of clear documentation, reproducible
workflows, and thoughtful visualisation when translating complex analytical
systems. It demonstrates how legacy code can be transformed into maintainable,
insight-focused pipelines suitable for modern data-driven environments.
